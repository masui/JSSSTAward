abstract = {In almost all computer applications, users must enter correct words for the desired
objects or actions. For success without extensive training, or in first-tries for
new targets, the system must recognize terms that will be chosen spontaneously. We
studied spontaneous word choice for objects in five application-related domains, and
found the variability to be surprisingly large. In every case two people favored the
same term with probability <0.20. Simulations show how this fundamental property of
language limits the success of various design methodologies for vocabulary-driven
interaction. For example, the popular approach in which access is via one designer's
favorite single word will result in 80-90 percent failure rates in many common situations.
An optimal strategy, unlimited aliasing, is derived and shown to be capable of several-fold
improvements.},
